# Steve's Weather Application - Overview

## Project Links

- [https://github.com/censoredbythefcc95/Project-2---React.git]()
- [add your deployment link]()

## Project Description

I will be building an application with React Router that will allow users to search weather information via zipcode or city. Users can input a desired ZIP Code or city, and the application will display the following elements:

- Current Temperature
- Expected High
- Expected Low
- Probability of precipitation (%)

## API

I will be implementing an open source API from Weatherstack to pull information regarding weather into this application. 



```
"location": {
        "name": "New York",
        "country": "United States of America",
        "region": "New York",
        "lat": "40.714",
        "lon": "-74.006",
        "timezone_id": "America/New_York",
        "localtime": "2019-09-07 08:14",
        "localtime_epoch": 1567844040,
        "utc_offset": "-4.0"
```


## Wireframes

Here are the official wireframes for my weather application. The first link is the basic wireframe on the appearance of the application. The second link is the architecture framework for my React components.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP EXAMPLE
- Find and use external api 
- Render data on page 
- Allow user to interact with the page

#### PostMVP EXAMPLE

- Add localStorage or firebase for storage

## Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App | This will make the initial data pull and include React Router| 
| Header | This will render the header include the nav | 
| Footer | This will render the header include the nav | 


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |

## Additional Libraries
I will probably use the following libraries and frameworks:

- React
- React Router
- SASS/SCSS
- Bootstrap

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description.  Code snippet should not be greater than 10 lines of code.
